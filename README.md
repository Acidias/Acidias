# Hey, I'm Mihaly 👋

**Software Engineer** based in London, building things that actually solve problems.

I'm into **AI, automations, and full-stack development** — turning ideas into shipped products. ☕

### 🔨 What I'm Working On

| Project | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| 🚗 **Vehicle Configurator** | PNG-layered visual configurator for custom vehicles — think Build-a-Bronco but better |
| 📊 **LinkedIn Dashboard** | AI-powered content creation & publishing platform for LinkedIn |
| ⚖️ **Legal Pack Analyzer** | AI tool that reads legal property packs so you don't have to |
| 🛒 **Vinted Automation** | Semi-automated buying & smart search for Vinted deals |
| 💇 **Beauty Salon Platform** | Booking & management system for salons |
| 🤖 **Kip** | My personal AI assistant running on a Raspberry Pi — manages my projects, emails, calendar, and roasts me occasionally |

### 🧠 Philosophy

> Build fast, ship faster, fix it in production. Just kidding — write tests. Sometimes.

I believe the best way to learn is to build something real. Every repo here started as "what if I could..." and turned into something people actually use.
